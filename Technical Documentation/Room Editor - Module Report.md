# Room Editor Module Report

## Specification
The Room editor is designed to modify basic properties of DeadSouls Room Class Files. The Module optionally takes a file path when starting, which it will attempt to open. Otherwise, it will simply open a brand new file ready to be saved. The user can edit basic properties of the room such as name, description, contained items, noises, etc. The user can save the file as a new one, or over an original file. Most input can be done from a simple textbox somewhere in the editor, and other edits can be done from a seperate code editing window, allowing you to write functionals or customise and specialise the data.
