# Daniel Selmes  - Development Log Book

### 3-02-14 Beginning Development
Today we started development. I set up a github repo, which should make it easy for everybody to have the latest version of the software we're making. I also began some of the design for the main application window. This window is supposed to be where the user manages thier files and for the domain and can save and load domains that they are currently working on. I have the basic layout done, but there's lots to improve on. I also made a small start on a set of icons for the application to use, to give visual hints as to what each UI element does. 

I learned that Visual Studio is pretty picky with keeping track of project files, and that if you don't move and delete stuff from inside Visual Studio, it ususally can't find the files it's looking for. I think there may also be some wierd side effects with github and Visual studio, but I'll have to look into that some more.
