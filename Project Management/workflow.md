#Workflow

This file outlines the intended workflow for users of our program, so we can consider all aspects of the program and make notes about possible problems and solutions. It'll be especially helpful when we come to the implementation and testing stage, as we'll need to figure out what the user might want to do whilst they're using the program, and how we can accomodate that.
