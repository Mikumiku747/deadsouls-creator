# Item Editor Module Report

## Specification
The Item editor is designed to modify basic properties of DeadSouls Item Class Files. The Module optionally takes a file path when starting, which it will attempt to open. Otherwise, it will simply open a brand new file ready to be saved. The user can edit basic properties of the item such as name, keyname, description, value, etc. The user can save the file as a new one, or over an original file. Most input can be done from a simple textbox somewhere in the editor, and other edits can be done from a seperate code editing window, allowing you to write functionals or customise and specialise the data. 

## Avaliable values
The following properties are covered by the editor:

 - Key Name
 - Short Name
 - ID
 - Adjectives
 - Description
 - Mass
 - Damage Points
 - Value
 - Persistance (Does it continue to exist when sold?)
 - Item vendor types

## Technical Documentation
