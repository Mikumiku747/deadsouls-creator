# Daniel Selmes  - Development Log Book

### 3-02-14 Beginning development
Today we started development. I set up a github repo, which should make it easy for everybody to have the latest version of the software we're making. I also began some of the design for the main application window. This window is supposed to be where the user manages thier files and for the domain and can save and load domains that they are currently working on. I have the basic layout done, but there's lots to improve on. I also made a small start on a set of icons for the application to use, to give visual hints as to what each UI element does. 

I learned that Visual Studio is pretty picky with keeping track of project files, and that if you don't move and delete stuff from inside Visual Studio, it ususally can't find the files it's looking for. I think there may also be some wierd side effects with github and Visual studio, but I'll have to look into that some more. 

### 6-02-14 Continued work on the interface
Today I did a ton of work on the interfaces, I pretty much finished up the main window, as well as getting a little bit of the navigation code done, and then started on the room editor. There are a lot of settings that can be very widely configured, such as exits, enters, and object description. I'll need to think up some kind of UI element or dialog that can let the user easily edit properties of an item. I'll also need to get the program to eventually compile these into proper C files.

I learned quite a bit about the customizable options of rooms and the different ways that you can present information to the mudlib. Mappings are a moderately complex data type that is very good for asscociating bits of information together with objects and properties of a room, and I'll need to find a way to effectively present them to the end user. It would also be good to have some kind of integrated functionality for functionals, which allow the user to write small custom functions that describe a room. 

### 8-02-14 Finished reading functionality for the mapping editor
Today and yesterday I spent quite a bit of time writing up a module with some LPC parsing functions, to make our lives easier when we start to re-write the rest of the modules. It's acutally really hard to parse code well. I also used these functions to pretty much finish up the reading functionality of the MS mapping editor. Hopefully the other mapping editors aren't so painful, there was a lot of work, and trial and error. I think it's mostly working now though. However, there's still some failsafe functionality that needs to be attached to some of the functions, in case they get passed values which don't work. I'm also going to have to test the modules later, to make sure they work.

I learned that alot of Visual Studio's guessing and suggestions are based on typing and documentation, and that when one of those is missing, it gets really hard to program the functionality you want. Thankfully, by explicitly typing (OOP typing, not keyboard typing) all my variables and providing the XML documentation for any functions I write, it makes it mostly easy to keep on top of things. Also, comments and temporary debug statements help as well.
