# deadsouls-creator
A program to generate LPC files for the deadsouls mudlib. 

##Working on this project
- First, Open GitHub and press sync, so that you have the most up-to-date version of the software. 
- Then, you can start making your edits and stuff. Be sure to make commits whenever you do something major, like re-write a module or start a new one. It's also a good idea to make a commit at the end of each work session as well, so you can roll back if you need to. 
- When you finish up a work session, you should press sync so that all of your changes are saved to the online version of the project. If you don't do this, other people won't see your work, which may be a problem.
- You should be able to open this folder just like a regular VB project. Just don't forget to sync everything when you're done. - Also, all of the engineer, user and development documentation is stored here as well in case something happens to it. 
- Finally, feel free to log issues when you need help or can't figure something out, and somebody else in the team will have a look and see if they can help. 

Have fun coding!
