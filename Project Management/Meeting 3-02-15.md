# Minutes of meeting - 3/2/15

- The program is going to have a modular layout, a form for each editor, so, one form for monsters, one for rooms, one for weapons/items
- There will be a main window that manages the files for your world, and allows you to make new rooms, weapons, monsters, etc. 
- Lots of the config options will be lists, so there should be an option to add any items that fit the purpose of this list, such as monsters for a list of NPCs
- Daniel Chin will be doing NPC, weapon and armour editors
- Daniel Selmes is doing the file manager, room creator
- Draw up the VB form first, then, once the client likes the design, we'll work on the backend of the code. 
- With making the actual files, the program should just fill out a template file and save it to the domains folder, and then the server should work.
